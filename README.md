 # Text-to-Text AI Pipelines with Gradio and Hugging Face

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of Hugging Face models for text-to-text tasks with Gradio, an open-source library for creating interactive UIs. The project includes three Jupyter notebooks, each showcasing different aspects of using Hugging Face pipelines and Gradio components.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. Simple Pipeline Notebook (`simple_pipeline_notebook.ipynb`)**
   - Description**: This notebook demonstrates how to use the GPT-2 model from Hugging Face to generate text based on an input prompt. It shows the model's functionality without the use of Gradio.
   - Key Features:
     - Load the GPT-2 model.
     - Generate text based on a given prompt.
     - Display the generated text.

### 2. **Gradio Components Notebook (`gradio_components_notebook.ipynb`)**
   - Description: This notebook highlights how to use various Gradio components such as textboxes, dropdowns, and sliders. It provides an example interface that allows users to interact with these components and see the results in real-time.
   - Key Features:
     - Use of `Textbox`, `Dropdown`, and `Slider` components.
     - Example of how to capture and display user inputs.
     - Demonstrates how Gradio components can be used together.

### 3. Full Pipeline Notebook (`full_pipeline_notebook_with_gradio.ipynb`)**
   - Description: This notebook integrates the Hugging Face GPT-2 model with Gradio to create a complete interactive text generation application. Users can input text into the Gradio interface, and the GPT-2 model generates and displays the output text.
   - Key Features:
     - Integration of GPT-2 model with Gradio.
     - Interactive UI for text generation.
     - Real-time display of model outputs.
